**Remember all the validation you do is in the 
mongoose level not in the database
level like sql mongo db does not care
if any data is extra added or not added
it just save the data. in Relational Database your data must match
the schema of the database level.
in mongodb there is no schema the schema is the mongoose
lavel.every validation you do is in the mongoose
not in the mongodb**
